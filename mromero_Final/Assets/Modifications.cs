/*
 I changed the Intensity of the directional light and changed the color to a light blue giving the water a blue tint
 Added Fog
 For the skybox I changed the sun size to 0.5, the atmosphere thickness to 1.6, the sky tint to a light blue, and the exposure to 1.4
 Chaos Balls: I made them into a prefab and added them to the scene. For the particle system I changed the color, made it into hemisphere shape and changed the rate over time. 
 Coloured Balls: I made them into a prefab
 Goals: I changed the colour intensity, and the range of them. I wanted to keep them the same color as the balls.
 Wall: I made the walls into having pillars and middle wide walls with spikes coming out of the pillars. I also put a new texture with a checkered look to them.
